STATUS: Archived
Riot doesn't like these kind of apps, so it got removed from Google Play, at the same time I lack the passion and time maintainting the project, so this will be archived.
Feel free to fork it, and use it as it should still work as of today.

# IOS release?

I didn't plan on releasing this app on IOS yet.
If you would like to see this app on AppStore feel free to contact me.

## Troubleshooting

On Long load times and infinite Loading states try restarting your app or clearing all data.
Loading assets will take some time with slow internet connection.

### Notifications

Some manufacturers like Xiaomi, OPPO etc. might instantly kill the process for longer battery times.

To avoid this change permissions and energy options in your settings for this app.

On Xiaomi: `Hold App Icon` > `App-Info` > `Battery saver` > `No restrictions`  

### No Notifications after Restart

Like the battery options, on some devices you need to enable `Autostart` for the app.

## Status

This Project is finished an will be maintained on changes from Riot.
